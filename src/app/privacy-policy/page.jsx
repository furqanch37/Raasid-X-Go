        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>1.</strong> <strong> Introduction</strong><br />
        At Raasid.com, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information. By using our website or services, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>2.</strong> <strong> Information We Collect</strong><br />
        We collect two types of data: personal information and non-personal information. Personal information may include your name, email address, phone number, billing and shipping address, and payment details. Non-personal information includes your browser type, IP address, device information, pages visited, and usage patterns — often collected via cookies and analytics tools.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>3.</strong> <strong> How We Collect Your Information</strong><br />
        We collect information directly when you fill out forms, place an order, subscribe to updates, or contact us. We also collect data indirectly using cookies, tracking pixels, third-party analytics (like Google Analytics), and through your interaction with our marketing platforms or social media pages.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>4.</strong> <strong> How We Use Your Information</strong><br />
        Your information is used to fulfill orders, provide customer service, send updates or promotional messages (with your consent), and improve your overall experience on our site. We also use data for internal analytics, product development, and content personalization.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>5.</strong> <strong> Sharing of Information</strong><br />
        We do not sell or rent your personal data. However, we may share it with trusted service providers—such as delivery companies, payment processors, or marketing agencies—only when necessary to complete your order or service request. These partners are obligated to protect your information and comply with privacy standards.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>6.</strong> <strong> Cookies and Tracking</strong><br />
        We use cookies and similar technologies to remember your preferences, enhance your browsing experience, and analyze website traffic. You can choose to accept or disable cookies in your browser settings. However, disabling cookies may affect the performance of some site features.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>7. </strong> <strong>Data Security</strong><br />
        We take strong security measures to protect your personal data. This includes secure servers, encrypted transactions, and limited access to your information. While no system is completely foolproof, we strive to keep your data safe using best industry practices.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>8.</strong> <strong> Data Retention</strong><br />
        Your information is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or to comply with legal obligations. Once the data is no longer required, we securely anonymize it.
        </p>

        <p className="terms-text"><strong className='numbers'>9.</strong> <strong> Your Rights</strong><br />
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data. You may also withdraw consent for marketing communications at any time. To make such a request, please contact us at the email provided below.
        </p>
